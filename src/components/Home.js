      The first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were: bones
      (used to tally items), pebbles, and counting boards, and the abacus,
      known to have been used by Sumerians and Egyptians
      before 2000 BC. With the advent of electronic calculator in modern times,
      accurate counting of a number can be brought out, mathematical calculations
      can be done quickly and accurately. It can perform a wide range of
      mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
      exponentiation, and more. Calculators are useful in many different settings,
      including scientific research, engineering, finance, and education.
      Man becomes more comfortable with developing new technology.
      The option of calculator is found in all electronic application devices.

      The need for calculators arises from the fact that humans have limitations
      when it comes to performing calculations. While we are capable of doing
      basic arithmetic in our heads or on paper, more complex  calculations can
      quickly become difficult and time-consuming. A calculator can perform
      these calculations much more quickly and accurately than a person could,
      making it a valuable tool in many different fields.
      In addition to speed and accuracy, calculators also have the advantage of
      being programmable, which means that they can be customized to perform
      specific tasks or functions. This makes them particularly useful in areas
      such as computer programming and engineering, where complex calculations
      and algorithms are often required.

      It is unworthy therefore, to lose hours in the labour of calculation which
      could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.
